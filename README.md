# Blueprint outline

This is a resource pack that adds an outline to some non full blocks to make it easier to rebuild it from a screenshot.

![Blocks with outline](/other/outline-demo.png)

The resource pack works by changeing the block models, and therefor every variant of slabs, stairs, and so on will be outlined.

## Blocks to add
- [x] Inner stairs
- [ ] Outer stairs
- [ ] Walls
- [ ] Full blocks?
	- Every block probably shouldn't be outlined
	- Only those with slab/stair variants?
- [x] Slab tops
- [x] Slabs
- [x] Stairs
